1. History


12th goal
Ensuring Sustainable Productiona and consumption pattern

The equivalent of more than 500 kilocalories of food per person a day is lost in the supply chain in Latin America and the Caribbean before it even gets to the final consumer. By reducing such waste, and promoting recycling, reuse, and more efficient practices across high-consumption economies and those highly dependent on natural resources, Goal 12 looks to bolster the mechanisms for sustainable development to flourish.

For improving thesee, some steps that we should take are:

Doing more with less: Goal 12 aims at doing more and better with the less. I'll give you an example,the recently held moon mission chandrayan 3,the budget was 615 crores . On the other hand,The apollo mission in 1969,the budget was 2500 crores which makes up a lot in todays date.
Many more mission like the india's mars mission was a very perfect example of doing more with less and we Indians are the master of "Jugaar" using anything to it's extent. We should normalise repairing things rather than renewing it.



Balancing the use of natural resources to foster growth:
Goal 12 encourages the efficient use and sustainable management of natural resources.There are many countries in the world which has a lot of Natural resources but still they are not developing ,do you know the reason behind it.It's just that they are not able to utilise it properly. Overuse of natural resources also leads to the downfall.As a report, in just about 30 years the coal and petroleum reserves will be over. So what are the steps we are taking to overcome it.
The electric cars. The hydroelectric powerplant.

Minizing food loss and waste.
